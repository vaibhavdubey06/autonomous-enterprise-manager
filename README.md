<h1 align="center">Autonomous Enterprise Manager (AEM)</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>An advanced, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent orchestration platform designed to automate enterprise workflows, facilitate dynamic AI collaboration, and seamlessly integrate with internal infrastructure.</strong>
</p>

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Autonomous Enterprise Manager (AEM)** is a state-of-the-art intelligent system built to handle complex, multi-step enterprise operations. Powered by state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini/OpenAI) and orchestrated using LangGraph, AEM functions as a digital workforce capable of breaking down high-level objectives, spawning specialized agents, and collaborating dynamically to resolve complex tasks.

Designed for production environments, AEM ships with enterprise-grade security, comprehensive observability, and highly resilient fault-tolerant infrastructure out of the box.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Utilizes a supervisor-worker architecture (via LangGraph) to intelligently route tasks, spawn specialized agents on-demand, and aggregate results.
- 🧠 **Persistent Context & Memory**: Implements advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) utilizing **Qdrant** for vector search and long-term conversation memory.
- ⚙️ **Workflow Automation**: Define, schedule, and execute complex workflows consisting of sequential or parallel AI tasks.
- 🔐 **Enterprise Security**: Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), API rate-limiting, JWT authentication, and full audit logging.
- 🔌 **Seamless Integrations**: Native integration with GitHub (PR reviews, issue tracking), Slack/Discord (communications), and extensible tool plugins.
- 📊 **Robust Observability**: Built-in OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics, and Chaos Engineering frameworks to guarantee system resiliency.
- 💻 **Interactive UI**: A beautiful, real-time Streamlit dashboard for monitoring agents, managing workflows, and chatting with the AI.

## 🏗️ Architecture Stack

AEM is built as a robust monorepo, separating concerns between the intelligent backend engine and the user-facing dashboard.

| Component | Technology | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Backend** | `FastAPI`, `LangGraph`, `uvicorn` | High-performance async API for agent execution and state management. |
| **Frontend** | `Streamlit`, `Altair` | Interactive dashboards and real-time chat UI. |
| **Database** | `PostgreSQL`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Alembic` | Relational storage for users, workflows, audit logs, and RBAC policies. |
| **Vector DB** | `Qdrant` | Highly efficient vector database for RAG, memory, and semantic search. |
| **Caching/Queues** | `Redis` | Session storage, rate limiting, and distributed locking. |
| **Deployment** | `Docker Compose`, `Nginx` | Containerized production environment with automated Nginx reverse proxying. |
| **CI/CD** | `GitHub Actions` | Fully automated CI/CD pipeline enforcing code quality, testing, and zero-downtime EC2 rollouts. |

## 🚀 Quickstart (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & Docker Compose
- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [uv (Astral)](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package installer

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavdubey06/autonomous-enterprise-manager.git
cd autonomous-enterprise-manager
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `apps/backend/` directory:
```bash
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
```
Edit the `.env` file to include your LLM API keys:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" # Optional fallback
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_pat"
```

### 3. Start the Platform
You can boot the entire stack locally using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```
> **Note:** The local `docker-compose.yml` mounts your local source code as volumes to enable hot-reloading.

### 4. Access the Applications
- **Frontend Dashboard:** [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- **Backend API Docs (Swagger):** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## 🌍 Production Deployment

The AEM platform is fully configured for automated deployment to AWS EC2 using GitHub Actions.

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Push to `main`**: Triggers the `Deploy` workflow.
2. **CI Pipeline**: Runs Ruff (linting), Black (formatting), MyPy (type checking), and Pytest (unit/integration tests).
3. **Artifact Generation**: Compresses the repository into a release archive.
4. **EC2 Rollout**: Authenticates via SSH, transfers the release, applies Alembic database migrations, and triggers a zero-downtime `docker compose up -d --build` recreation using a symlink-based release strategy.

### Required GitHub Secrets
To enable automated deployments, configure the following secrets in your repository settings:
- `EC2_HOST`: The IP address of your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_USER`: The SSH username (e.g., `ubuntu`).
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: Your private `.pem` key used to authenticate with the EC2 instance.

## 🧪 Testing and Quality Assurance

AEM enforces strict engineering standards through automated testing and formatting.

**Run Unit & Integration Tests:**
```bash
cd apps/backend
uv run pytest
```

**Run Code Linters & Formatters:**
```bash
uvx ruff check apps/backend apps/frontend
uvx black --check apps/backend apps/frontend
```

**Run Chaos Engineering Tests (Simulate Faults):**
```bash
cd apps/backend
uv run pytest tests/chaos/test_chaos.py
```
